## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Tailwind CLI installation and setup
- `clamp()` isn't always heavily necassary, in this project I used it minimally since Tailwind UI is responsiveness friendly by default
- Use of relative and absolute position for dialog UI
- Refined my understanding of `OnClick` and `addEventListener` while making this project.
